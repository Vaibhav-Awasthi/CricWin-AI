# CricWin-AI : IPL Winning Team Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts the probability of an IPL team winning a match based on real match data from **2009 to 2019**. The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle** and has been fine-tuned using machine learning algorithms to achieve an **accuracy above 90%**. The project features a **Streamlit-based web application** for interactive predictions.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: The model is trained and fine-tuned for over **90% accuracy**.
- **User-Friendly Web App**: Built with **Streamlit** for easy user interaction.
- **Real IPL Data**: Uses **official IPL match data (2009-2019)**.
- **Probability Prediction**: Provides a **winning probability** for both teams.
- **Fully Automated Pipeline**: Preprocessing, training, and prediction handled efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** üêç
- **Scikit-learn** (ML Model)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **Streamlit** (Web Deployment)
- **Pickle** (Model Serialization)
